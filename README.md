# lord-of-the-react
Lord of the Rings is a series of fantasy novels written by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. It is a sequel to his novel The Hobbit.

## App
This app features descriptions of humans, hobbits, monsters, etc from the series. More specficially, it features the following
- A creature along with a description facts about it (Bilbo, 100+ year old hobbit whose life was ruined by the ring). Tolkien's universe has a vast amount of creatures. Creatures is an abstract term. It can be anything from a human to a ghost to a dragon.
- My take on the creature, as a Catholic that never readst he bible, on how it relates to Catholicism. Tolkien was a well known Catholic and it is thought that he incorporated his beliefs into the mythology
- Optional: An amateur drawing of the creature

## Stack
- Frontend
  - React
- Backend
  - Node
  - Mongo
  - Express

## Architectural Brainstorm
The plan is for each creature to have an entry in a mongodb databse. The react app will interact with the express server which will interact with the db.
